my original project idea was a western dueling game. 
I should've done a local test before setting up network, and there were so many bugs I scrapped it and turned it into a ball battle arena, since demonstrating multiplayer was the most amount of points.

It looks simple, but it is server authoritative, and different materials can be used to build or lose momentum. Clicking multiplies your mass by 10, so you can mega hit other players. (the demo doesn't look that cool with just me playing)

I had a lot of issues changing the github from the broken game to this one, let me know if something isn't working properly and I can fix it.
